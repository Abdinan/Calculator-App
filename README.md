A. WHAT YOU SEE?
1. I built a simple single-page calculator application.
2. The main screen includes numbers from 0 to 9. Buttons; +, -, /, * and their actions.
3. And, a label to show the result of the process.

B. HOW IT LOOKS? 
1. I used MVC architecture by Swift with UIKit.
2. There is only one storyboard. All design processes in a single storyboard.
3. Filled the buttons on the screen by using horizontal and vertical stack views.
4. I used constraints to make a dynamic sized stackview.
5. Alignment was changed up to me. 

C. HOW IT WORKS? 
1. Finally inserted outlets and actions of the buttons to the controller.
2. Made the calculation by the operator.
3. Used functions to make different calculations.
